\chapter{Technicality}

They departed the conference room, leaving only Piriuses in it for their private moment before Xander's departure. In the hall adjacent to the room other Commissioners stood slightly to the side, while Cassius, Aurora and EDF CoGS stood by the door.

\say{Bogdan looks broken,} remarked Aurora, \say{it doesn't mean any good.}

\say{You bet}, commented EDF CoGS, \say{a man like him will take this deeply personally. He will exact revenge. And he will be right to do so, in a sense.}

Joff Cassius finally understood what had bothered him so much during Xander's speech.

\say{Listen}, he said, \say{something is off with Xander. All his friends and associates described him as generally unable to speak in long meaningful sentences without a pair of 'fucks' in between. But now just listen to him. 'Incorporeal immortality', 'civilizational exchange', that inspirational speech worth of Joan of Arc. What the hell with this newfound oratoric skills?}

\say{Krax is taking him over}, suggested Aurora.

An hour later Joff Cassius was flying his glider with Xander to the Enwarian embassy. Xander was silent almost all the way, but when they were on the final approach, he suddenly asked, \say{Commissioner, does it ever weigh you down? All these billions of people you are responsible for. Each having his own dreams, hopes, aspirations, failures, reasons and people to blame, reasons and people to continue for. I never thought of it this way.}

\say{Call me Joff. Yes, Xander, it does weigh me down. Every day. I busy myself with a routine to keep a grip of sanity.}
