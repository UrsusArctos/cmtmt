\chapter*{Preface}

% \section*{Setting}

This story was written without a plan or any plot thought through in advance, just on pure inspiration. The general idea was borrowed from one of the American classic sci-fi writers of the XX century, only I read that short story so long ago I don't remember its title or the author's name.

The story is set in the future when the humanity finally went interstellar and encountered an alien race of Enwarians. Fifty years later, several billion Enwarians live in the Solar System and just as much humans live on Enwarian homeworld to a mutual benefit.

One evening, a seemingly ordinary Enwarian is killed by a human in an accident that initially appears to be drunken bar fight. However, the Enwarian ambassador visits local Earth domain Commissioner to hint on the importance of the victim. Commissioner begins his own investigation into the accident that nearly brings mankind on the brink of war with the aliens.
